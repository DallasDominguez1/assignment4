    <div><h3>For people interested in health and fitness who have the need to track their calories in a fast and simple way we are introducing SnailScale. It is a scale with a camera that detects the food type on the scale, weighs it and calculates calories. It’s different from MyFitnessPal and other apps that calculate calories because the user doesn’t have to input any data in order to know the calories, and they just need to put the food on the scale. We generate revenue by hardware purchasing and app subscription.</h3></div>

    <div><h3>Jacob's Law - Users want your system to work the same way as a system they already know. 

      We have designed snail scale in a form similar to a regular food scale. The design is inviting,
      sporting a wide open plate that says "HEY! PUT FOOD ON ME!" Our design is not meant to push stylistic
      boundaries, but instead provide a minimilistic design approach to a complex task. This is reflected
      in the single pillar that houses both the camera and the light, as to not take up more space than needed.</h3></div>

    <div><h3>Law of Proximity - Proximate objects tend to be grouped together. 

      We have grouped a set of buttons together responsible for the operations of power toggling, tare (or zeroing
      out), and changing units from grams to oz, and taking images. The camera and light source are placed together on the tower, and
      all electronics are hidden underneath the cylindrical outer shell. Steve Jobs would be proud.
      </h3></div>

    <div><h3>Hick's Law - Decision Making Time Increases with the number/complexity of options.

      We aimed to make our UI as simple as it can possibly be while still being as easy and as intuitive as
      possible for the user. We have simple operations and most of the electronics are hidden besides the camera lens,
      the light, and the scale interface. We aim to design it to be perceived a singular 'unit' rather than some complex
      device. The selection menu would allow the user to take images, view current measurements, select food options and criteria,
      and see food nutritional info (perhaps externally).</h3></div>
